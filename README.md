# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
In this module, an analysis of PyBer data was performed with Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. For this challenge, we created a new DataFrame for the summary of ride-sharing data by city type. We then used Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multi-line graph to show the weekly fares for each city type. 

## Resources 
Data Sources: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
Software: Python 3.9.7, Jupyter Notebook
